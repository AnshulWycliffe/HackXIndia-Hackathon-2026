### Biomedical Waste Management System for Civic Bodies

CivicBio is a **role-based, QR-enabled biomedical waste management platform** designed to help civic authorities monitor, regulate, and audit the complete lifecycle of biomedical waste — from **generation at healthcare facilities** to **collection and final disposal**.

The system focuses on **accountability, traceability, and compliance**, aligned with India’s **Biomedical Waste Management Rules**.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Biomedical waste mismanagement leads to:
- Public health risks  
- Environmental contamination  
- Lack of traceability and accountability  
- Manual, paper-based compliance  

Existing systems lack **real-time visibility**, **digital verification**, and **role-based control**.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

CivicBio introduces a **digitally traceable workflow** using:
- Role-based dashboards  
- QR code–based waste tracking  
- Civic approval & profile locking  
- Real-time KPIs and audit trails  

Every waste batch is **digitally verifiable** at each stage.

## 👥 Actors & Roles

### 🏥 Facility (Hospitals / Labs / Clinics)
- Register and set up facility profile  
- Generate biomedical waste batches  
- Print & paste QR codes on waste bags  
- Track pickup and disposal status  
- View compliance status  

### 🚛 Collector
- Verify facility via QR scan  
- Scan waste batch QR to mark as collected  
- Upload pickup proof  
- Report issues  
- Hand over waste to disposal unit  

### ♻️ Disposal Unit (CBWTF / Incinerator)
- Scan waste QR to verify eligibility  
- Select disposal method  
- Mark waste as disposed  
- View daily KPIs  

### 🏛️ Civic Authority
- Approve / reject profiles  
- View city-wide KPIs  
- Monitor waste lifecycle  
- Track reported issues  

---

## 🔁 Waste Lifecycle

Facility → QR Generation → Collection → Disposal → Civic Audit

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

**Backend:** Python, Flask, MongoDB (MongoEngine)  
**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery  
**Storage:** Supabase (Not used in prototype)  
**Other:** QR Codes, jsQR, IST timezone handling

🔑 Demo Login Credentials (For Evaluation)

Use the following dummy accounts to explore different roles in the system:

password : admin (common for all)

Facility -> facility@mail.com \
Collector -> collector@mail.com \
Disposal Unit -> disposal@mail.com\
Civic Authority -> civic@mail.com

⚠️ These accounts are for demonstration purposes only.

### 🗺️ Mock Data & Heatmap Note

The heatmap and analytics views use mock / sample data to demonstrate:
 - Waste density across zones
 - Disposal concentration
 - Civic monitoring capabilities

This is intentional for the hackathon prototype to:
 - Showcase scalability
 - Demonstrate data-driven governance
 - Avoid dependency on real civic datasets

## 🎯 Hackathon Focus

CivicBio is designed as a **governance-first prototype**, emphasizing real-world applicability, regulatory compliance, and traceability.
